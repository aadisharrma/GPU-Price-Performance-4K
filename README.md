## 📊 What's Inside

A single-page visual dashboard comparing modern 4K gaming GPUs across three views:

- **Performance Bar Chart** — relative 4K rasterization scores vs. current retail price
- **Value Rankings** — GPUs sorted by performance-per-dollar for 4K gaming
- **Budget Guide** — best picks from $200 up to $3,500+

## 📌 Data Notes

- Prices reflect **current retail/street prices** as of February 2026, not launch MSRP
- Performance scores are **relative 4K rasterization** benchmarks (RX 9070 XT = 100 baseline)
- Sources: GamersNexus, Tom's Hardware, Digital Foundry aggregated benchmarks
- DLSS 4 / FSR 4 upscaling scores are **not** included in the base perf numbers

## ⚠️ Market Context

A GDDR7 memory shortage + U.S. tariffs have pushed retail prices 30–100%+ above MSRP for most cards. Update prices regularly for accuracy.
